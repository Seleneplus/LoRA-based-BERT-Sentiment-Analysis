# LoRA-based BERT Sentiment Analysis

This project fine-tunes a **BERT** model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for sentiment classification on the **IMDb Movie Review** dataset.  
The final model is deployed as a **Gradio web application** for real-time prediction.

---

## Features
- **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning** with LoRA (updates <1% of model parameters)
- **BERT-base** model for binary sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)
- **IMDb dataset** with 50,000 labeled movie reviews
- **Gradio-powered** interactive demo for real-time text sentiment prediction
